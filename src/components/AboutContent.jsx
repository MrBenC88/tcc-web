              Why Tech Career Change?
            </Heading>
            <Text fontSize="lg" color="black">
              In 2019, our founders faced the challenge of deciding whether to
              commit to a second degree in technology. With limited resources
              and a perceived stigma around unconventional routes, they
              struggled to find a community and support systems tailored for
              individuals like themselves.
              <br />
              <br /> After successfully transitioning from their previous degree
              to computer science, our founders decided to create Tech Career
              Change to fill the gap for people looking for a supportive space
              during their tech career transition. <br />
              <br />
              Our focus is to provide resources, mentorship, and a sense of
              belonging for anyone interested in, currently transitioning to, or
              already thriving in the tech industry.
